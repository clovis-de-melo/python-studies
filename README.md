# Python studies

Repository created in order to study and test Python programming language. 

## Developer commands

*Python* 

```
python --version

py --version

python -V

python app.py
```

*Git* 

```
git rm -r --cached .
git add . 
git commit -m "Untrack files in .gitignore" 
```

You can use the following command if you want to ignore an specific file. 

E.g: *node_modules*

## Keywords

`Pyhton`

Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language.. It is a generalist language, that is, it can be used to create a variety of programs. 

Python is widely used in: 

* Software Development
* Web Development 
* Data Science 
* Machine Learning
* Scientific Computing
* Automation 

`Jupyter`

*JupyterLab* is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

The *Jupyter extension for Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) enables users to work with Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code. The Jupyter PowerToys extension adds additional features to the Jupyter experience. 

Jupyter extension allows users to:

* to use any Python environment as a Jupyter kernel
* to create, open, and save Jupyter Notebooks
* to work with Jupyter code cells
* Allows users to connect to a remote Jupyter server
* Allows users to debug a Jupyter Notebook

Please note: 

This is *not* a Jupyter kernel--you must have Python environment in which you've installed the Jupyter package, though many language kernels will work with no modification. To enable advanced features, modifications may be needed in the VS Code language extensions.

`Anaconda`

Anaconda is an open-source distribution of Python that's used for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It includes a package manager, Conda, and a graphical user interface, Anaconda Navigator.

*Packages*

Includes pre-installed packages like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, and thousands more available for installation 

*Package management*

Conda analyzes the environment before installing packages to avoid conflicts 

*Environments* 

Isolated workspaces that can be customized for specific projects 

*Jupyter Notebooks*

Works with this open-source web application for creating and sharing documents with equations, code, and visualizations 

`Google Colab`

Google Colab, or Colaboratory, is a free, browser-based environment for writing and running Python code. It's hosted on Google's cloud servers. 

*Features* 

* No setup: You don't need to configure anything to use Colab. 
* Free access to GPUs and TPUs: You can use these powerful computing resources for free. 
* Easy sharing: You can share your notebooks with others. 
* Store in Google Drive: You can save your notebooks to your Google Drive account.

*Use cases* 

* Data science: Analyze and visualize data using Python libraries
* Machine learning: Import image datasets, train image classifiers, and evaluate models
* Education: Use Colab for educational purposes

*How it works* 

* You can write and execute Python code in a web browser. 
* You can combine code, rich text, images, HTML, and LaTeX in your notebooks. 
* You can access your Google Drive directly from your notebook.
