### Keywords

`Pyhton`

Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language.. It is a generalist language, that is, it can be used to create a variety of programs. 

Python is widely used in: 

* Software Development
* Web Development 
* Data Science 
* Machine Learning
* Scientific Computing
* Automation 

`Jupyter`

*JupyterLab* is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

The *Jupyter extension for Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) enables users to work with Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code. The Jupyter PowerToys extension adds additional features to the Jupyter experience. 

Jupyter extension allows users to:

* to use any Python environment as a Jupyter kernel
* to create, open, and save Jupyter Notebooks
* to work with Jupyter code cells
* Allows users to connect to a remote Jupyter server
* Allows users to debug a Jupyter Notebook

Please note: 

This is *not* a Jupyter kernel--you must have Python environment in which you've installed the Jupyter package, though many language kernels will work with no modification. To enable advanced features, modifications may be needed in the VS Code language extensions.

`Anaconda`




`Google Colab`
