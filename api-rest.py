# API Rest 

"""A REST API (Representational State Transfer) follows a few architectural principles:

* Uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
* Has resources identified by URLs (for example /api/breeds/list/all).
* Returns structured representations of those resources (usually JSON).
* Is stateless - each request contains everything the server needs (no session storage)
